# üé¨ IMDB Movie Data Analysis Project üìä

## üìù Introduction
This project involves the analysis of the "IMDB-Movie-Data" dataset, which includes films made between 2006-2016. The dataset includes the highest-rated films on IMDB according to the years. The variables included for each film in the dataset are Title, Genre, Description, Director, Actors, Year, Runtime (Minutes), Rating, Votes, Revenue (Millions), and Metascore.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
The analysis was carried out in the following steps:

1. **Importing Python Libraries**: The necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization were imported. These include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and others.
2. **Loading the Dataset**: The "IMDB-Movie-Data" dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation and analysis.
3. **Preliminary Analysis**: Preliminary analyses were conducted to understand the structure, content, and properties of the dataset. This included checking the number of entries, the type of variables, and basic statistical summaries.
4. **Missing Value Analysis and Imputation**: The dataset was checked for missing values. Appropriate strategies were employed to handle these missing values, such as imputation or deletion, based on the nature of the variable and the extent of missing data.
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Interpretation of Findings**: In this step, relationships between variables were analyzed using various graphical representations, including histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. The findings from the EDA were then interpreted. This comprehensive analysis and interpretation process included understanding the distribution of movie ratings, the relationship between revenue and rating, the impact of the director on the movie rating, and other interesting insights. This combined approach allows for a more integrated understanding of the data.

## üìö Findings
The following questions were answered during the analysis:
1. List of movies with a runtime of 180 minutes or more.
2. The year that had the highest average voting.
3. The year that had the highest average revenue.
4. The average rating for each director.
5. The top 10 longest movies by title and runtime.
6. The number of movies made each year.
7. The title of the most popular movie (highest revenue).
8. The top 10 highest rated movies along with their directors.
9. The top 10 highest grossing movies.
10. The year-wise average rating of movies.
11. The correlation between rating and revenue.
12. The number of action movies in the dataset.

## üéì Conclusion 
The analysis of the "IMDB-Movie-Data" dataset provided valuable insights into the characteristics of high-rated movies on IMDB. The findings from this project can be used to understand what factors contribute to a movie's success and can guide future movie production decisions.
